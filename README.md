# ActiveAdminAutoSelect

This gem is a little widget which combines Select2, PostgeSQl and ActiveAdmin and helps you filter objects in ActiveAdmin based on the id but with the help of some other fields.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'admin_auto_select'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle
    
Add the following directive to your Javascript manifest file:

``
//= require autoselect
``

## Usage

After installing the gem, you have to add some lines into the model you want to auto_select. 
For example, if you want to add the widget to the users id filter:

### Call the method defined in the module in order to create the collection_action

first_name, :last_name, :email are the fields which help you find the desired user

```ruby
 auto_select :first_name, :last_name, :email
```

### Then change the relevant filter in your model

Notice: :id_eq is necessary.
data-scope is the desired scope which will be used by the widget in order to fetch the similar users.
data-url is also necessary and is the url generated by the action which is defined in the module.

```ruby
  filter :id_eq, label: "User", input_html: { data: { scope: 'user',
                                                        url: 'users/autoselect',
                                                placeholder: 'Select user'     } }
```

### Instantiate the js class in your active_admin js file with the generated filter input.

```
newAutoSelect = new AutoSelect(input: $("#q_id_eq))
```
